      "Description:\n",
      "The download service component of the cwa-server backend can be forced into an endless loop by a malicious or faulty federation gateway server. When downloading new batches from the federation gateway server, the download service checks the nextBatchTag header of the federation gateway server’s response. If this header is set, the download service will continue requesting a batch with this tag. It will not stop as long as the server includes this header. This can trap the download service in an endless loop.\n",
      "This highly depends on the behavior and implementation of the federation gateway server. However, even a non-malicious, faulty implementation might trigger this issue. Additionally, the issue was sometimes hard to reproduce as the server first has to be forced to request new batches (which in some cases required setting the EFGS_ENABLE_DATE_BASED_DOWNLOAD configuration to true).\n",

      "The following snippets show a minimalistic federation gateway server mock that returns invalid data but sets the nextBatchTag header on each response.

If it is already contained in the list of unprocessed batches, it should not be added again. This does not protect against a malicious server that sends different batch tags on each request. Therefore, alternatively, a timeout value or a maximum number of retries could be introduced.\n",

      " - Labels: ['bug']\n",

      " - Created at: 2020-06-11T11:08:29Z\n",

      " - Description: Rating: Low\n",
      " \n",
      "Description:\n",
      "The submission server configures a whitelist for endpoints in its ``SecurityConfig.java`` which allows ``'/actuator/**'`` to be accessed. \n",
      "This generally exposes all available *Spring framework* endpoints to the web. This is mitigated via the ``application.yaml`` which configures \n",
      "all available endpoints to only be accessible on port ``8081``.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though this configuration does not have an immediate impact on the security of the application, it could mean that any mistake in the ``application.yaml`` will disclose potenially sensitive *Spring* endpoints to the Internet.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is recommended to scope the whitelisting of endpoints within ``SecurityConfig.java`` to explicitly match endpoints used, on ports on which they are active. This would mean to e.g. explicitly whitelist ``'/actuator/health'`` or ``'/actuator/prometheus'`` on port ``8081`` within ``SecurityConfig.java``.\n",
      "\n",
      "Proof of Concept:\n",
      "The following code excerpts show the configuration of the endpoint whitelisting for any *Spring* actuator endpoint. As can be seen, access is neither limited to a port or specific endpoint, nor is authentication required.\n",

However, this is still a deviation from the documented API.\n",
