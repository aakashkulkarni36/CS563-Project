Benchmark
(gathering) API services, issues No., bug type, consider?, modified file, modifiled line numbers, comments
(final) API services, issues No., bug type, modified file, modifiled line numbers



1. Collect a set of issues (API, link to issues) 
    Script to loop through each API
        loop through closed issues and label as bug (maximum 10 issues)
2. Each one of us go through the same issues independtly and identify the bug type
    Identify the bug type using only the user description, and issue conversation
    Then identify the modified file, and line number from commit
    add comment if needed for helping understand the issue during consolidation
3. go through the issues one by one (until we consider maximum 100 issues that are within our scope)
    check if we have different bug type, modified file, and line numbers
        if we have different, discuss what would be the bug be
            if we cannot agree on issues, as it is hard to categories
                a) create a new category that fit the bug
                or
                b) disregard the issue 
    if we have the same bug type, or we discussed and agree on the same issues, discuss should we consider it in our Benchmark
    reasons to not consider the issues:
    a) ???
4. End
