API services, issues No. link, bug type, consider?, modified file, modifiled line numbers, comments



1. Collect a set of issues 
    Script to loop through each API
        loop through closed issues and label as bug 
2. Each one of us go through the same issues independtly and identify the bug type
    Identify the bug type using only the user description, and issue conversation
    Then identify the modified file, and line number from commit
    add comment if needed for helping understand the issue during consolidation
    decide if it is within our scope of REST API fault, and fill up `consider?`
3. go through the issues one by one 
    not consider the issue if majority of us not consider the issue in our own separated list
    check if we have different bug type, modified file, and line numbers
        if we have different, discuss what would be the bug be
            if we cannot agree on issues, as it is hard to categories the bug type
                a) create a new category that fit the bug
                or
                b) not consider the issue
